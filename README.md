# Taco Mania
The purpose of this app is to allow the user to like the already existing tacos, and add a new taco to the taco database.

## Welcome to Taco Mania!
The user can see the navigation bar at the top of the page. Check out our faves! While browsing, get the real authentic vibe of our app by listening to some Mariachi music!

You will learn our faves! Amelia wants to Live MÃ¡s, cause she loves Taco Bell! Jessica's loves a good authentic steak taco! Mike is always fishing for some great fish tacos! 

Also included is the most popular taco and the least liked at the time of page load. Although Jessica likes her steak tacos, it's not the most popular by a long shot! Disagree? Give steak tacos a like! Like the prom king or queen, carnitas holds the crown for most liked taco. 

Taco item details appear when the page loads, allowing the user to see the name, rating, and number of likes for the taco. What is your favorite taco? Also included is the rating! Do you agree, or would you rate them differently?

Adding your own taco is a fun way to interact. Will you pick a safe, classic taco or will you spice up your life by adding something wild and unique?
